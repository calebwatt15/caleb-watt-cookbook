# Things I Cook
This is a literal cookbook (as in for food) that has recipes I use. I will attempt to keep recipes up to date as I make them, as well as add in credit if I got the recipe from someone other than myself.

## Compiled Version
A compiled version can be found in the root repository directory, called cookbook.pdf.

## Recipe Format
Recipes will follow the following basic format:
* Title
* Time to make
* Number of people a dish serves
* Ingredients required
* Hardware required (often ignores common things, such as knives, measuring spoons, silverware, etc.)
* Instructions to make the dish
* Notes on the dish, pain points you may ecnounter, credit for the original version of the dish, substitutions, etc.
