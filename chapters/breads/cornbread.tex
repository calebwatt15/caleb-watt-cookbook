\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This is Cyndy Watt's recipe, straight up. I have not changed it from my days growing up, as my mom already makes my favorite cornbread.
    \item White cornmeal could be used, but it's less corny, and leads to a slightly softer, less tasty bread.
    \item All cornbreads sit on a spectrum ranging from sweet and cakey to drier and less-sweet. I tend to say these range from a nearly cake-like texture to actual bread. My mom's is not quite as dry as some, but is definitely not really sweet or cakey.
    \item You can add corn kernels or jalape√±o if you like, but I don't normally. It's a nice special treat. Corn will make this more moist, so you may need to reduce the amount of milk.
    \item While you can use a full cup of milk instead of milk and buttermilk, it's really just not the same.
