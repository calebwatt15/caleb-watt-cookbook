\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This is Alton Brown's recipe, as seen here: \url{https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/vanilla-sugar-recipe-1914687}
    \item If this sits long enough, the sugar tends to set and get hard. I break it up and throw chunks in a blender briefly to get it back in a granulated form.
