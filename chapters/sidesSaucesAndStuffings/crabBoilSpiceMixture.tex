\subsection*{Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Combine all ingredients in a bowl.
    \item Store in an airtight container in the pantry for short term, or in the freezer for long-term.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item While this was very good, it tasted basically exactly like Zatarain’s Crab Boil. Main differences are that right now, this recipe costs about \$10 to make, whereas Zatarain’s is on Amazon, and it costs \$10 for 6 pots worth.
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Zatarain’s also already comes in boil bags, which is super nice.
    \end{itemize}
    \item If you bought spices at bulk, it might be cheaper, but given the trouble of straining or getting tea cloth to boil in, I will likely just buy Zatarain’s in the future.
