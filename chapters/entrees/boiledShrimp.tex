\subsection*{Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Place 1 quart of water per pound of shrimp you are making into a large pot.
    \item Dump spice mixture into water, and let water come to a hard boil.
    \item When the water has good color from the spice, strain the water into another large pot, to remove the seeds and chuny mixture.
    \item Let spiced water come to a hard boil once again.
    \item Add shrimp, and let cook for about 4 minutes.
    \item Strain shrimp out of water.
    \item Enjoy with cocktail sauce.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item While this worked well, Zatarain’s is equally as good and much easier to use. I will likely just follow the Zatarain’s boil instructions and use their mix.
