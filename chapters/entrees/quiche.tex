\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adding other vegetables can be done, such as grilled bell peppers or onion, however more veggies is more moisture, which can make it take longer to set, which browns the crust more. Be wary of adding too many veggies.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Might can offset this by thawing the broccoli more, need to test.
