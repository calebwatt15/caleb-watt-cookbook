\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This is the rice recipe as seen in Acadiana Profileâ€™s Cajun Cooking: From the Kitchens of South Louisiana, Part 1, 1990.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item My only difference is I pretty much always use oil over butter.
    \end{itemize}
    \item If you need more rice at a time, just ensure that there is enough water to cover the rice by about one joint of your index finger. Increase oil and salt, but not proportionate to this recipe. Experiment for larger batches of rice.
